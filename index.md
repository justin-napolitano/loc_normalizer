# Library of Congress Normalizer Job

This [repo](https://github.com/justin-napolitano/loc_normalizer) normalizes the existing library of congress schema into a db that wil then be used to construct a knowledge graph of supreme court law. 

## Plan

1. Setup a venv to run locally
2. Install requirements
3. Write out the script to interface with gcp
4. Set up a docker container and test locally
5. build the image
6. upload to gcp
7. create the job

## Setup the venv

### Install
I installed virtualenv locally on ubuntu

### Create
I then run ```virtualenv {path to venvs}```

### Activate

Then source the venv bin to activate

```source {path to venv}/bin/activate```
   
### Install requirements

``` pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Write out the Script

### Steps

1. Access the loc_scraper Bucket
2. Grab a json blob
3. Process the blob
4. Move the blob to a processed bucket


### Data Organization

I want to create workflow class with the following methods

1. get_creds
2. grab_blob
3. process_blob
4. move_blob

The process_blob method will be a lot of work.  I might just flatten the json and dump into a table. I will then write a normalization workflow


### Get Creds

If running locally I will need some creds in the enviornment. I will take create a key from the console and download it for local run . 








## Setup the Docker Container

### The Dockerfile

Also available on [github](https://github.com/justin-napolitano/loc_normalizer/blob/main/Dockerfile)


```
# # Use the Alpine Linux base image
# FROM alpine:latest

# # Set the working directory inside the container
# WORKDIR /app

# # Copy a simple script that prints "Hello, World!" into the container
# COPY /src/hello.sh .

# # Make the script executable
# RUN chmod +x hello.sh

# # Define the command to run when the container starts
# CMD ["./hello.sh"]


# Use the official Python image from Docker Hub
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY ./src /app
COPY requirements.txt /app

# Install any needed dependencies specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Run the Python script when the container launches
CMD ["python", "loc_scraper.py"]
```


## Quickstart


### Gcloud cli
After this you will have to install gcloud cli and configure you're local environment. I will write up some scripts in a subsequent post to automate this process... but for the time being check out this ["link"](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

### Create the image

In the repo there is a a bash script called ```build.sh``` that will need to be updated to according to your gcp project.

```bash
gcloud builds submit --region=us-west2 --config cloudbuild.yaml
```

It calls ```cloudbuild.yaml``` which might need to be updated for you, but the following the should work.

```yaml
steps:
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  script: |
    docker build -t us-west2-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/supreme-court-scraper/supreme-court-scraper-image:dev .
  automapSubstitutions: true
images:
- 'us-west2-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/supreme-court-scraper/supreme-court-scraper-image:dev'
```

### Following creation of the imge 
Next you can create a job on gcp by runnning the ```job_create.sh``` script... or by copying the code below and chaging yourproject to the correct project-name

```bash
gcloud run jobs create supreme-court-scraper --image us-west2-docker.pkg.dev/yourproject/supreme-court-scraper/supreme-court-scraper-image:dev \
```

### Executing the job

Once complete you can execute the job by running the ```execute_job.sh``` script or by running 

```bash
gcloud run jobs execute supreme-court-scraper
```

### Putting it all together

In a perfect world the following should work. Note that src/.env should be set with your environmental variables such as ```$GCPPROJECTID``` 

```bash
source src/.env \
&& ./build.sh \ 
&& ./job_create.sh \
&& ./execute_job.sh
```

## Running locally

The python script in the ```/src``` can be run locally, however it should be modified if you choose not to use gcp.  There are a number of functions within that can easily be modified to permit writing to the local directory.

## Write out the Script

### Steps
1. Initialize the Google Logging Service
2. Initialize The Google Cloud Storage Service
1. Initialize the Bigquery Client
2. Grab a json blob
3. Process the blob
4. Move the blob to a processed bucket


#### Initialize The Google Cloud Storage Service

I created a Gloud Service Client Class available at : https://github.com/justin-napolitano/gcputils/blob/bc421debf4c828522580ec79ab634b2e2bf402a4/GoogleCloudLogging.py

It is imported below and tested below.  Note that cli specific arguments are commented out for testing in ipynb. 


```python
# loc_flattener.py
# library_of_congress_scraper.py

from __future__ import print_function
from gcputils.gcpclient import GCSClient
from gcputils.GoogleCloudLogging import GoogleCloudLogging
from gcputils.BigQueryClient import BigQueryClient
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
import json
import os
import time
from pprint import pprint
import html
from flatten_json import flatten
import google.cloud.logging
import logging
import argparse
import pandas as pd
from google.cloud import bigquery
```


```python

def initialize_google_cloud_logging_client(project_id, credentials_path=None):
    return GoogleCloudLogging(project_id, credentials_path=credentials_path)


def main():
    # parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Run the script locally or in the cloud.')
    # parser.add_argument('--local', action='store_true', help='Run the script locally with credentials path')
    # args = parser.parse_args()

    project_id = os.getenv('GCP_PROJECT_ID', 'smart-axis-421517')
    bucket_name = os.getenv('BUCKET_NAME', 'loc-scraper')

    credentials_path = None
    # if args.local:
    credentials_path = os.getenv('GCP_CREDENTIALS_PATH', 'secret.json')

    # Initialize logging
    logging_client = initialize_google_cloud_logging_client(project_id,credentials_path)
    logging_client.setup_logging()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Initialize the Google Cloud Storage Client

The Google Cloud Storage Client is available at https://github.com/justin-napolitano/gcputils/blob/bc421debf4c828522580ec79ab634b2e2bf402a4/gcpclient.py

Calling the client and listing the buckets to test below


```python

def initialize_google_cloud_logging_client(project_id, credentials_path=None):
    return GoogleCloudLogging(project_id, credentials_path=credentials_path)

def initialize_gcs_client(project_id, credentials_path=None):
    return GCSClient(project_id, credentials_path=credentials_path)

def list_gcs_buckets(client):
    try:
        buckets = client.list_buckets()
        print("Buckets:", buckets)
        logging.info(f"Buckets: {buckets}")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error listing buckets: {e}")

def main():
    # parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Run the script locally or in the cloud.')
    # parser.add_argument('--local', action='store_true', help='Run the script locally with credentials path')
    # args = parser.parse_args()

    project_id = os.getenv('GCP_PROJECT_ID', 'smart-axis-421517')
    bucket_name = os.getenv('BUCKET_NAME', 'loc-scraper')

    credentials_path = None
    # if args.local:
    credentials_path = os.getenv('GCP_CREDENTIALS_PATH', 'secret.json')

    # Initialize logging
    logging_client = initialize_google_cloud_logging_client(project_id,credentials_path)
    logging_client.setup_logging()

    gcs_client = initialize_gcs_client(project_id, credentials_path)
    list_gcs_buckets(gcs_client)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

    trying creds file
    Buckets: ['loc-scraper', 'loc_flattener_processed', 'processed_results', 'smart-axis-421517_cloudbuild']


#### Access the Blobs within the bucket

Now I need to grab a blob from the bucket. IN this case I just want to grab one from the top of the heap without pulling a lot of data into context. 

##### Addition to the storage class 

```Python

def list_blobs(self, bucket_name):
        """
        Lists all blobs in the specified bucket in Google Cloud Storage.

        Args:
            bucket_name (str): Name of the bucket.

        Returns:
            list: A list of blob names.
        """
        # Get the bucket
        bucket = self.client.bucket(bucket_name)
        
        # List all blobs in the bucket
        blobs = list(bucket.list_blobs())
        
        blob_names = [blob.name for blob in blobs]
        return blob_names

def pop_blob(self, bucket_name):
        """
        Selects and removes the first blob from the specified bucket in Google Cloud Storage.

        Args:
            bucket_name (str): Name of the bucket.

        Returns:
            google.cloud.storage.blob.Blob: The first blob from the bucket.
        """
        # Get the bucket
        bucket = self.client.bucket(bucket_name)
        
        # List all blobs in the bucket
        blobs = list(bucket.list_blobs())
        
        if not blobs:
            print(f"No blobs found in bucket '{bucket_name}'.")
            return None

        # Get the first blob
        first_blob = blobs[0]
        
        print(f"First blob selected: {first_blob.name}")
        return first_blob

```

##### Test Run 


```python
def initialize_google_cloud_logging_client(project_id, credentials_path=None):
    return GoogleCloudLogging(project_id, credentials_path=credentials_path)

def initialize_gcs_client(project_id, credentials_path=None):
    return GCSClient(project_id, credentials_path=credentials_path)

def list_gcs_buckets(client):
    try:
        buckets = client.list_buckets()
        print("Buckets:", buckets)
        logging.info(f"Buckets: {buckets}")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error listing buckets: {e}")

def main():
    # parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Run the script locally or in the cloud.')
    # parser.add_argument('--local', action='store_true', help='Run the script locally with credentials path')
    # args = parser.parse_args()

    project_id = os.getenv('GCP_PROJECT_ID', 'smart-axis-421517')
    bucket_name = os.getenv('BUCKET_NAME', 'loc-scraper')

    credentials_path = None
    # if args.local:
    credentials_path = os.getenv('GCP_CREDENTIALS_PATH', 'secret.json')

    # Initialize logging
    logging_client = initialize_google_cloud_logging_client(project_id,credentials_path)
    logging_client.setup_logging()

    # List Buckets for testing
    gcs_client = initialize_gcs_client(project_id, credentials_path)
    list_gcs_buckets(gcs_client)

    # Grab A blob from the heap
    first_blob = gcs_client.pop_blob(bucket_name)
    if first_blob:
        print(f"First blob name: {first_blob.name}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

    trying creds file
    Buckets: ['loc-scraper', 'loc_flattener_processed', 'processed_results', 'smart-axis-421517_cloudbuild']
    First valid blob selected: last_page.txt
    First blob name: last_page.txt


#### Some additions to avoid last_page.txt

So there is a last page.txt that is used by the scraper program. I want to pass some regex patterns to exclude in the pop_blob method


```python
def pop_blob(self, bucket_name, patterns_file = None):
        """
        Selects and removes the first blob from the specified bucket in Google Cloud Storage,
        excluding any blobs that match patterns from the provided file.

        Args:
            bucket_name (str): Name of the bucket.
            patterns_file (str, optional): Path to the file containing regex patterns to exclude.

        Returns:
            google.cloud.storage.blob.Blob: The first blob from the bucket that doesn't match any pattern.
        """
        # Load regex patterns from file
        patterns = []
        if patterns_file:
            with open(patterns_file, 'r') as file:
                patterns = [line.strip() for line in file]

        # Get the bucket
        bucket = self.client.bucket(bucket_name)
        
        # List all blobs in the bucket
        blobs = list(bucket.list_blobs())
        
        if not blobs:
            print(f"No blobs found in bucket '{bucket_name}'.")
            return None

### GCP Cloud Run 

I want this to run autonomously for me on GCP

To do this I will need to 

1. Create a DockerFile
2. Build the image on gcp
3. create a job to run it

### Create the DockerFile

My Dockerfile looks something like this. Ignore the quickstart code thta i've commente dout. I use that as a reference.

[GH Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justin-napolitano/loc_normalizer/main/Dockerfile)


```yaml
# # Use the Alpine Linux base image
# FROM alpine:latest

# # Set the working directory inside the container
# WORKDIR /app

# # Copy a simple script that prints "Hello, World!" into the container
# COPY /src/hello.sh .

# # Make the script executable
# RUN chmod +x hello.sh

# # Define the command to run when the container starts
# CMD ["./hello.sh"]


# Use the official Python image from Docker Hub
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY ./src /app
COPY requirements.txt /app

# Install any needed dependencies specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Run the Python script when the container launches
CMD ["python", "loc_scraper.py"]
```


#### Using Cloudbuild

I want to automate the entire build and deploy process by passing the steps to google's cloud build service.  

My [file](https://github.com/justin-napolitano/loc_normalizer/blob/main/src/cloudbuild.yaml) looks like this...

```yaml

steps:
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    args: ['build', '-t', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/$IMAGE_NAME', '.']
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    args: ['push', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/$IMAGE_NAME']
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud'
    args: ['run', 'deploy', '$SERVICE_NAME',
           '--image', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/$IMAGE_NAME',
           '--platform', 'managed',
           '--region', '$REGION',
           '--allow-unauthenticated']

substitutions:
  _PROJECT_ID: 'smart-axis-421517'
  _IMAGE_NAME: 'loc-flattener-image'
  _SERVICE_NAME: 'loc-flattener'
  _REGION: 'us-west2'  # e.g., us-central1

timeout: '1200s'
```

#### Submit the build

To sbumit the build run the following from the cli or save to as script.

```bash
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml .
```


```python

```
